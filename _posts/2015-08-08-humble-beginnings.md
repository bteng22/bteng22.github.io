"The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step", so the ancient [Chinese proverb][proverb] echoes. The wisdom of Laozi is uncannily synonymous with one of my favorite [childhood commercials][commercial], "How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?". Nonsense most would say, but I would retort, "It begins with a single lick…". And thus I make my ‘lick' today, not on said tootsie pop, but on the digital world. Of course to most, my post just looks like another pile of words on the web, but to me it's definitely a monumental step--a step towards vulnerability and courage.

Truth be told, I've always been hesitant to speak, paralyzed by what others may think. But I decided it was time to candidly confront my fears. Afterall, who else, besides me, is really going to take the time to read this. *cue crickets...* There’s plenty of other mediums to suffice the yearning web-wanderer. I, by no means, intend to fulfill the wanderlust of others, but instead, hope to clasp my own walking stick and blaze a trail true to my heart.

But I digress! Internet real estate is plentiful unlike our attention spans. If you've stuck around this long, feel free to hop onto my blog-mobile as I attempt to exploit imagination's curious intricacies through movement of the mind, of the body and of the soul. Join me as I attempt to operate my rickety hooptie through perplexing thickets of existential questions and over ominous mountains of technological endeavors into the deep dark depths of my mind as I try to discover what it takes to be a creative, what it means to inspire, and what it possibly feels like to free others from concern, even if only for a fleeting moment…

Until next time—farewell traveler!
