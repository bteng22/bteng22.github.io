<h2 id="welcome" class="section-heading">Hello World</h2>
<p>
  It seems you’ve stumbled upon the peripheral corners of this vast cosmic void.  Most people refer to it as the Internet, the World Wide Web, the information highway, but to me, it's simply a bridge for my voice, my ideas, and my experience. As such, I felt I should introduce myself to you in an appropriate way....

  All jokes aside, I am currently a Consultant/Application Developer of ThoughtWorks, Inc., a proud alumnus of the University of Southern California (Fight on Trojans!), and a motivated Chicagoan making his way from the urban outskirts of Rogers Park to the metropolitan heart of San Francisco. As a self-taught technology enthusiast, I hope to connect with individuals who strive to make a dent in this world in order to help others. With a relatively transient journey in software development thus far, I am walking the long road of understanding the complex and turbulent world of programming. It’s been one helluva ride, but I love the challenges it offers, and I really aspire to share this passion with the rest of the world to encourage others to continue their pursuit no matter the adversity...ADVENTURE IS OUT THERE!
